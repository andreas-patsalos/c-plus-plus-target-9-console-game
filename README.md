# c-plus-plus-target-9-console-game

A small console Target 9 game using C++, created as part of the coursework of my Data Structures course.

This program was coded in the VSCode environment.

Game instructions:

The game starts with an initial configuration of digits, based on the difficulty (minimum number of moves) that the user will select (1 to 9), and the target is to change all of them to a 9 in the minimum number of moves.
